The provided code represents a framework for a 2D space shooter game,  inspired by the game Alien Invasion. It includes classes for managing game statistics, player scores, and ship mechanics.

The GameStats class tracks essential game information, such as the score, high score, levels, and remaining ships. The PowerUp class implements temporary enhancements to the player's abilities,

activating under certain conditions and managing their duration. The Scoreboard class handles the display of scores, high scores, levels, and remaining ships on the screen, while also storing and

loading the high score from a JSON file. The Settings class contains game configuration details like bullet characteristics, speed settings, and score scaling. Finally, the Ship class manages the

player's ship, including movement, power-up states, and visual representation. Together, these components create a cohesive game structure that facilitates gameplay, scoring, and visual feedback.
